    <h1> Seattle </h1>
    <h2> 图图 </h2>
    <p1> Seatlle is my cat and she is only one years old. She got the name because the day I got into UW she became a member of our family. She loves sleeping and watching birds, and her favorite food is yogurt. Kittens might grow up to be timid if they are not socialized early. Although every cat has its own personality, all cats have some characteristics that some people find endearing and others find off-putting.</p1>

    <h3> How to feed a kitten? </h3>
    <p2> Between the fourth and sixth week, gradually transition the weaning kittens to dry food, supplementing with formula if needed. Use canned food or dry kitten food mixed with water; at first, add a lot of water, and then reduce the amount of water as the kitten matures.A kitten’s weight may double or even triple during the first few weeks of life. To support this explosive growth -- as well as high activity levels -- your kitten may have triple the energy needs of an adult cat.These high energy needs make it harder for kittens to get enough calories in one meal, says Jennifer Larsen, DVM, PhD, nutritional consultant and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital at the University of California, Davis. “So most kittens want to eat at least three or four meals a day,” she says. “It’s also a comfort thing -- kittens are snackers at heart.”</p2>
